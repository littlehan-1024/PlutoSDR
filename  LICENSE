Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                        Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works. This license is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program, to make sure it remains free software for all its users. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software and share your changes with others, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

Developers that use the GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.

Some people think that simply because a program is free, it is automatically good to use. But there is a big difference between free software and proprietary software. Proprietary software is software that is not free; it restricts your freedom to share and change it. The GPL aims to ensure that any software that is based on GPL-licensed software is also free.

Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to make it clear that everyone is permitted to use and distribute the software as long as they follow the rules of the license.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

   This License refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

   "Copyright" also means copyright-like rights such as those
   concerning proprietary databases.

   "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

   To "modify" a work means to copy from it and change it, or to combine it with another work. A work "based on" the Program means either the Program or a modified version of the Program.

   A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a modified version.

   "The source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a work.

   "You" means the licensee of the Program. "Your" has a corresponding meaning.

1. Source Code.

   The Program must include a copy of this License, and the source code for the Program must be made available to all recipients of the Program. The source code must be available in a form that is suitable for modification, and it must be accompanied by a copy of this License.

2. Basic Permissions.

   You are permitted to copy, distribute and modify the Program under the terms of this License. You may also charge a fee for the distribution of the Program.

3. Copyleft.

   You must distribute all copies of the Program and all modified versions of the Program under the same license. You must not impose any further restrictions on the rights granted by this License.

   You may convey a modified version of the Program under the terms of this License, provided that you include a prominent notice stating that you have changed the Program and the date of the change.

5. Distribution of Source Code.

   You must provide a copy of the source code for the Program to all recipients of the Program. If you distribute the Program in object code form, you must also provide a copy of the source code.

6. Warranty Disclaimer.

   The Program is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind. The authors are not liable for any damages arising from the use of the Program.

7. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or use a copy of the Program. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works.

8. Termination.

   This License will terminate automatically if you fail to comply with its terms. However, if you cure the violation within 30 days, your rights under this License will be reinstated.

9. Future Versions.

   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GPL. You may choose to follow the terms of that version or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.

   There is no warranty for the Program. The authors are not liable for any damages arising from the use of the Program.

11. Limitation of Liability.

   In no event shall the authors be liable for any damages arising from the use of the Program.
